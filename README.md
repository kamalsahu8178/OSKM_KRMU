First, we designed a login page where users enter their name and select their role: Student, Staff, or Admin.
In the Student Panel, students can view the canteen menu and select food items. After placing the order, a mock QR code is generated for payment. Once the payment is completed, an Order ID is generated. Students can then track their order status, such as whether the order is preparing, ready, or delivered.
In the Staff Panel, staff members can view incoming orders along with the Order ID, ordered items, payment status, and total amount paid. After preparing the food, the staff updates the order status to ready or delivered, ensuring smooth order handling.
The Admin Panel is responsible for overall control and management. The admin can add new items, remove items that are out of stock, and manage the menu efficiently. This helps maintain proper inventory and avoids confusion during ordering.
The aim of our project is to simplify and streamline canteen management, reduce waiting time, improve order tracking, and provide a better experience for students, staff, and administrators.
This project was successfully developed and presented as part of the Built and Beyond Hackathon.
